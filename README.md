This repository contains the field temperature and precipitation estimates extracted from PRISM that were used in the field survey and iButton analyses in "Nonlinear effects of temperature on mosquito parasite infection across a large geographic gradient", Farner et al., Ecology, 2025.
The Google Earth Engine scripts used to extract these data are available in the Dryad repository associated with the publication.
